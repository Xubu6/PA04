Effort Report - Programming Assignment 4

For this assigment, lots of PA03 could be reused. Therefore, Milestone 1 was not a large challenge. 
However, Spark was new to all our group member, and there were many complications in just the installation. 
We installed Spark, but there was difficulty running the master, and so we eventually had to uninstall and reinstall, 
and in our second attempt, we got Spark working. After we got Spark working, we tried to create k8s clusters, but
we ran into many issues with not many ways to debug these, so we decided to use Spark on its own. We then worked to
create code for the Map and Reduce functions to generate the data. 
Overall, we found it very difficult to debug with spark. The error messages were vague, especially in setting up the 
master, and the instructions did not correctly specify what IP addresses to use always (between private and public). 
However, we learned a lot about Spark and the general work arounds for software installations and setups. We also 
learned how to successfully implement map and reduce, something none of us had done before.
