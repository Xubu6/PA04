Teamwork Assessment - Programming Assignment 4

We tried to work as a group for this assgignment, but it was hard to communicate with all team members. Therefore, 
the assignemnt was mostly done by Alan and Elle. We used Alan's machine to run Spark. Elle and Alan stayed in 
communication and had zoom meetings to complete the assignment, but it was a much slower process with only 2 group 
members, and we faced trouble with VMs crashing and having to restart.
